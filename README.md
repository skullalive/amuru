#Amuru
===========================

https://travis-ci.org/thynquest/amuru#

Amuru is a tiny command invoker/dispatcher pattern library. for now it is in it's alpha version but his goal is to work
with any python application (django etc) where there is a need to drive a client command operation, that send a command over a treatment process.
It also provides logging feature during operation treatment, with the possibility to choose the output (either console or file -> amuru.log)
